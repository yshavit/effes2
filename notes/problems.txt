Things like `typf` make it hard to know what the stack looks like at any given moment. It basically means that any verification of that would have to be known via a branched analysis, rather than just proving that any given op always has a given stack before and after its execution. Not sure of the implications of that.

"see if" is pretty un-intuitive. It's all about side effects, and the fact that it's happening is subtle in how you read the line. For instance:

    see if parseArgs(toks) is _Parsed(@args, @toks)

My first reaction was: "see if it is... and if it is, then what?"

Maybe something like:

    bind parseArgs(toks) if _Parsed(@args, @toks)

That's not great either, but it's better. Bears more thinking.
